# 0x03. Unity - UI

## Tasks

#### Task 0. Scoreboard
Clone your 0x02-unity-scripting repo into a new repo called 0x03-unity-ui. Like the previous project, this project should be inside its own repo, not within a subdirectory.

Create a new Canvas GameObject:

* Render Mode: Screen Space - Overlay
* Pixel Perfect: Yes
* UI Scale Mode: Scale With Screen Size

Inside the Canvas, create a new UI Image GameObject and name it ScoreBG. Anchor it to the top right of the game window using Anchor Presets.

* Pos X: -80
* Pos Y: -40
* Width: 100
* Height: 30
* Image color: #000000
* Alpha: 200

Create a new Text GameObject named ScoreText. Make ScoreText a child of ScoreBG. Anchor ScoreText to the middle of ScoreBG using Anchor Presets.

* Width: 100
* Height: 30
* Text: Score: 0
* Font size: 18
* Alignment: Center + Middle
* Horizontal Overflow: Overflow
* Font color: #FFFFFF


#### Task 1. What does "new high score" mean? Is that bad? Did I break it?
Edit the PlayerController.cs script. Create a new public Text scoreText variable. In the Inspector, set the value of the scoreText field to your ScoreText GameObject.

Create a new method void SetScoreText().

* When called, this method should update the ScoreText object with the Player‘s current score.
* Remove or comment out your Debug.Log line printing score to the Console.


#### Task 2. HP
Inside the existing Canvas GameObject, create a new UI Image GameObject and name it HealthBG. Anchor it to the top left of the game window using Anchor Presets.

* Pos X: 80
* Pos Y: -40
* Width: 100
* Height: 30
* Image color: #FF0000
* Alpha: 230

Inside the existing Canvas GameObject, create a new Text GameObject called HealthText. Make HealthText a child of HealthBG. Anchor HealthText to the middle of HealthBG using Anchor Presets.

* Width: 100
* Height: 30
* Text: Health: 5
* Font size: 18
* Alignment: Center + Middle
* Horizontal Overflow: Overflow
* Font color: #FFFFFF


#### Task 3. Health inspection
Edit the PlayerController.cs script. Create a new public Text healthText variable. In the Inspector, set the value of the healthText field to your HealthText GameObject.

Create a new method void SetHealthText().

* When called, this method should update the HealthText object with the Player‘s current health
* Remove or comment out your Debug.Log line printing health to the Console


#### Task 4. Win, lose, or draw
Inside the existing Canvas GameObject, create a new UI Image GameObject and name it WinLoseBG. Anchor it to the center of the game window using Anchor Presets.

* Pos X: 0
* Pos Y: 70
* Width: 200
* Height: 60
* Image color: #FF0000

Inside the existing Canvas GameObject, create a new Text GameObject called WinLoseText. Make WinLoseText a child of WinLoseBG. Anchor WinLoseText to the middle of WinLoseBG using Anchor Presets.

* Width: 160
* Height: 30
* Text: Leave empty for now
* Font size: 14
* Alignment: Center + Middle
* Horizontal Overflow: Overflow
* Vertical Overflow: Truncate
* Best Fit: Yes
* Font color: #FFFFFF

Set WinLoseBG as inactive by unchecking the box next to the object’s name at the top of the Inspector.

#### Task 5. Chicken dinner
Edit the PlayerController.cs script so that when the Player touches the Goal:

* You Win! displays in the WinLoseText UI element
* WinLoseText‘s color changes to black
* WinLoseBG’s color changes to green
* Remove or comment out your Debug.Log line printing You Win! to the Console


#### Task 6. Game over, man, game over
Edit the PlayerController.cs script so that when the Player‘s health reaches 0:

* Game Over! displays in the WinLoseText UI element
* WinLoseText’s color changes to white
* WinLoseBG’s color changes to red
* Remove or comment out your Debug.Log line printing Game Over! to the Console


#### Task 7. Wait a second...
The transition from the Game Over! text and the scene reloading is very sudden and abrupt. Let’s use a [coroutine](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/O5SHYPuhCBEmSmLzpnTUWA) and WaitForSeconds() to create a delay where once the Player‘s health is 0 and the Game Over! text is displayed, the scene waits 3 seconds to reload.

Create a new method IEnumerator LoadScene(float seconds):

* This method should call WaitForSeconds before reloading the current scene
* To utilize this method as a coroutine, call it with StartCoroutine() (ex. StartCoroutine(LoadScene(3)))


#### Task 8. What's on the menu
Create a new scene called menu in the Project window. Add a new UI Panel GameObject called MenuBG:

* Color: #313131
* Alpha: 200

Inside the existing Canvas GameObject, create an empty GameObject called MainMenu. Anchor it to the center of the game window with Anchor Presets.

* Width: 250
* Height: 200

Inside MainMenu, create three UI Button GameObjects PlayButton, OptionsButton, QuitButton. Anchor them to the center of the game window using Anchor Presets.

* PlayButton Pos Y: 60
* OptionsButton Pos Y: 0
* QuitButton Pos Y: -60
* Width: 180
* Height: 40
* Normal Color: #FFFFFF
* Highlighted Color: #9EECBC
* Pressed Color: #A9A9A9


#### Task 9. Let's play
Create a new C# script MainMenu.cs. Create a new method public void PlayMaze().

* This method should load the maze scene when the Play button is pressed.
* Under File > Build Settings, add your menu and maze scenes to the build.


#### Task 10. We're not retreating, we're advancing! Toward future victory!
Inside the MainMenu.cs script, create a new method public void QuitMaze().

* This method should close the game window when the Quit button is pressed.
* Since this will not work in the Unity editor preview, add a Debug.Log() message that writes Quit Game to the Console when the Quit button is pressed.



#### Task 11. A narrow variety of options
Inside the existing Canvas GameObject, create an empty GameObject called OptionsMenu. Anchor it to the center of the game window with Anchor Presets.

* Width: 250
* Height: 200

Create a new UI Text GameObject called OptionsTitle and anchor it to the top center of the OptionsMenu GameObject using Anchor Presets.

* Width: 160
* Height: 30
* Text: OPTIONS
* Font Style: Bold
* Font Size: 24
* Alignment: Center + Middle
* Horizontal Overflow: Overflow
* Color: #FFFFFF

Duplicate one of the buttons from the MainMenu and rename it to BackButton. Change the text to Back. Anchor it to the bottom center of the Options Menu GameObject using Anchor Presets.

Set the OptionsMenu GameObject to inactive by unchecking the box next to the object’s name at the top of the Inspector.

Now, instead of creating a script to switch between the MainMenu and OptionsMenu, use the UI Button’s built-in OnClick() event instead.

* MainMenu > OptionsButton: Create OnClick() events so that when this button is pressed, it sets OptionsMenu as active and MainMenu as inactive
* OptionsMenu > BackButton: Create OnClick() events so that when this button is pressed, it sets MainMenu as active and OptionsMenu as inactive


#### Task 12. Accessibility
Having red traps and a green goal isn’t very accessible design for certain types of [colorblindness](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/0zQvwmazM5Q6fmuHZE8tzw). Ideally in game design, it would be better to avoid color coding important mechanics or objects entirely. For the sake of this UI project, we’ll add a Colorblind Mode option for our maze.

Add a UI Toggle GameObject called ColorblindMode to the OptionsMenu GameObject.

* Toggle Label: Colorblind Mode
* Label Text Alignment: Left + Middle
* Position the checkbox on the right of the label as shown in the screenshots below

Edit the MainMenu.cs script and add three new variables:

* public Material trapMat
* public Material goalMat
* public Toggle colorblindMode

In the Inspector, assign the materials trap and goal and the toggle ColorblindMode to their respective variables.

Within PlayMaze(), check if colorblindMode is toggled on. If it is, change the trap and goal material colors:

* trap material color: new Color32(255, 112, 0, 1) (See: [Material.color](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/2GDMgQX6al2omACqx_c3iA), [Color32](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/U64Zs4Tym4F8ptE7eOvDPA))
* goal material color: Color.blue
